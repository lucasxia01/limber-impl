//! Trait scaffolding for running IntMod-Spartan over a
//! runtime-determined prime field (the dual-field driver).
//!
//! The existing `Engine` trait (in `traits/mod.rs`) bakes the sumcheck field
//! into the curve via `Engine::Scalar: PrimeField + PrimeFieldBits + …`. Those
//! `ff` traits require a compile-time-known modulus (`MODULUS: &'static str`),
//! which excludes dynamic-modulus arithmetic. The dual-field driver needs the SNARK
//! arithmetic to happen modulo a verifier-sampled ~128-bit prime, so this file
//! introduces a parallel trait hierarchy:
//!
//!   - [`SumcheckField`]: a field-like interface that does **not** require a
//!     static modulus. Implemented by both static-modulus curve scalars
//!     (via a blanket impl) and by the runtime-modulus
//!     `DynPrime` type (backed by `crypto-bigint::MontyForm`).
//!
//!   - [`SumcheckEngine`]: the minimum surface that `sumcheck.rs` needs. Both
//!     `Engine` and [`ModEngine`] implement it (via blanket impls).
//!     Loosening `impl<E: Engine> SumcheckProof<E>` to `impl<E: SumcheckEngine>`
//!     is what lets the sumcheck code run over either static or dynamic fields
//!     without algorithmic changes.
//!
//!   - [`ModEngine`]: the engine for `IntModSpartanModpSNARK`. Bundles a
//!     `SumcheckField` (the dynamic prime), a [`ModPCSEngineTrait`] (the
//!     Mod-PCS), and a transcript. **Deliberately PCS-agnostic** — does not
//!     assume the Mod-PCS sits on an elliptic-curve / Pedersen commitment;
//!     FRI-based, hash-based, or other underlying structures are also fine.
//!
//!   - [`ModPCSEngineTrait`]: PCS interface for committing polynomials over
//!     `Self::Scalar` and opening them at `Self::Scalar` points. The Mod-PCS
//!     analog of `PCSEngineTrait`. Concrete impls hide their underlying
//!     machinery (curve+Pedersen, FRI, Merkle, etc.) entirely.
//!
//! This file only defines the trait shapes. `sumcheck_modp.rs` and
//! `imod_spartan_modp.rs` consume them; `provider/mod.rs` supplies the
//! concrete `ModEngine` impls (`T256DynPrimeEngine` and the Brakedown-
//! backed variants).
